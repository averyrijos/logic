# Treatise on Logical Consequence

## Introduction

Logical consequence is a foundational concept in logic, mathematics, and philosophy. It describes the relationship between statements such that if certain premises are true, a conclusion must also be true. This treatise explores the formal and informal aspects of logical consequence, its significance, and its applications.

## Formal Definition

In formal logic, a statement *C* is a logical consequence of a set of premises *P* if and only if, in every model where all premises in *P* are true, *C* is also true. Symbolically, if *P ⊨ C*, then *C* is true in all interpretations where every member of *P* is true.

### Semantic Consequence

Semantic consequence relies on the notion of truth in a model. For example, in classical propositional logic, if *P = {A, A → B}*, then *B* is a semantic consequence because in every model where *A* and *A → B* are true, *B* must be true.

### Syntactic Consequence

Syntactic consequence is based on derivability within a formal system. If there exists a sequence of applications of inference rules that derive *C* from *P*, then *C* is a syntactic consequence of *P*, denoted *P ⊢ C*.

## Importance in Reasoning

Logical consequence underpins deductive reasoning. It ensures that conclusions drawn from true premises are themselves true, preserving truth through inference. This is essential in mathematics, computer science, and philosophical argumentation.
