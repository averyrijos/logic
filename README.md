# Logic: The Codex of Generativity and Metaformal Thought

This repository is a comprehensive archive and living codex for the study, development, and evolution of logic, generativity, and the architecture of intelligence. It integrates philosophy, formal systems, metaformal science, and ontological inquiry, serving as a resource for researchers, theorists, and practitioners seeking to advance the boundaries of thought and system design.

## Vision & Purpose

Logic is not merely a tool for deduction‚Äîit is the generative engine of becoming, transformation, and the creation of new worlds. This project aims to:
- Systematize and transcend classical, non-classical, and metaformal logics
- Explore the generative principles underlying intelligence, agency, and creativity
- Bridge analytic, continental, and meta-modern paradigms
- Provide a universal framework for the formalization of difference, contingency, and power
- Serve as a foundation for future research in artificial, super-generative, and ontopolitical intelligence
