## Corpus

The `Corpus/` directory contains foundational texts and essays, including:

- **Metaformal Proof of Artificial Superintelligence**: Explores the formal underpinnings of superintelligent systems.
- **PRINCIPIA GENERATIVARUM**: A codex on generativity and universal logic.
- **Super-Generative Intelligence**: Discusses ontological perspectives on future systems.
- **The Formal Logic of Post-Modernism**: Examines logic in post-modern and meta-modern contexts.
- **The Metalogical Codex of Generativity**: Proposes a universal architecture for becoming and generativity.
- **The Scar Theory of Systems**: Investigates systemic theory and its philosophical implications.

## Key Topics

- **Philosophy of Logic**: Foundations, paradoxes, and the evolution of logical systems.
- **Generativity**: Theories and models of generative processes in logic and intelligence.
- **Metalogic**: Higher-order logic and meta-theoretical frameworks.
- **Artificial & Super-Generative Intelligence**: Formal proofs and conceptual analysis.
- **Post-Modern & Meta-Modern Paradigms**: Shifts in logic and science in contemporary thought.

## Usage

This repository is intended for:
